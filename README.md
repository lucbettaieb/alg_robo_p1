<h3>Algorithmic Robotics, Project 1</h3>
<p>The purpose of this project will be to implement a robot using STDR simulator (http://stdr-simulator-ros-pkg.github.io/) that will be able to wander through an environment using a simple, constrained motion planning algorithm and localize using filtering techniques.</p>
<p>If time permits, I will also construct an occupancy grid map using a similar technique.</p>
