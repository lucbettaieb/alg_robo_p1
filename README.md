<h3>Algorithmic Robotics, Project 1</h3>
<p>The purpose of this project will be to implement a robot using STDR simulator (http://stdr-simulator-ros-pkg.github.io/) that will be able to be controlled in a lineat fashion using a simple, constrained motion program and localize using a Kalman Filter.</p>
<p><b>The Velocity Model</b> uses a linear assumption of position using the 'equations of motion' one learns in an introductary physics course.  It is able to update the estimated position using this motion model and the current commanded velocity.</p>
<p><b>The Sensor Model</b> uses a rangemap comparison technique which can accurately predict the position using a set of previously recorded laser scan data within a set tolerance<p>
